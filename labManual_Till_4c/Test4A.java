/*Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. 
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters 
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. 
(eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). 
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings. 
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Sample 1:
input=
abcdef
agcdk                                              

output=
3                      

Explanation: "acd" is the longest common subsequence
