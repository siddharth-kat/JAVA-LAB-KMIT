/*Cricketer's Pension Continuing our journey in mastering the conditional statements & our interest with cricket.
Let us help the Indian cricket's governing body (BCCI) to 
automate its plan of allotting pensions to former players. 
The rules are given below:  
If a player has played more than 10 test matches and 100 ODI's he receives Rs.50,000.
If a player has played more than 10 test matches he receives Rs.25,000.
If a player has played more than 100 ODI's he receives Rs.15,000.
If a player has played for India he receives Rs.10,000.
The amount is incremented by 1/4th for every 'man of the match' 
award.
If a player has not played for India but played IPL he receives an amount of Rs.8,000. 
If a player has not played for India nor IPL he receives an amount of Rs.7,000.
